EMPLOYMENT ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Software developer, IBM (2014-06 — Present)
Single-handedly collecting, processing, curating and reporting the entirety of billing data for IBM's Development Support Team (https://dst.ibm.com). Through enhancing existing code and developing new programs, our small team was able to automate and improve the processes and increase the internal revenue of the organization in the order of thousands of dollars every month. I also participated actively in the innovation office projects in order to explore new areas of development, documenting insights and presenting demonstrations of results.
- Used IBM Watson's Natural Language Processing, Speech-to-text and Text-to-speech APIs to configure Pepper and Nao humanoid robots in the Cognitive Concierge Project in order to enable them to understand and answer questions from the conference attendees.
- RFID tracking with analytics project: Built a proof of concept of an internal solution for the registration of attendees in IBM conferences while also providing mobile applications and a RFID tracking system used to identify the attendees' participation during the event. Then, used that data to gain insights and displayed a dashboard using the Watson Analytics platform. This would replace the current outsourced solution while also adding value using only internal resources and tools. Accomplishments: A proof of concept that would replace the outsourced solution was completed in under two months, and a fully-working live demo was shown during the IBM Interconnect 2017 conference in Las Vegas.
