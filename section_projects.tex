                      is about making space accessible to everyone on 
                      this planet - In other words, democratizing access 
                      to Space. We leveraged IBM / RedHat technology 
                      to allow students worldwide to interact 
                      directly with a CubeSat in Low Earth Orbit - giving 
                      them the ability to use code to access data from 
                      various sensors, take pictures, perform calculations, 
                      and get the results back down to Earth via ground 
                      stations and the IBM Cloud.
