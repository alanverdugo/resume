        {
            \begin{itemize}
                \item In less than a month, our team built a proof of concept 
                    of a solution to the registration of attendees in 
                    conferences, while also providing mobile applications and 
                    an RFID tracking system used to identify the attendees' 
                    participation in the venue.
                \item Used the captured data to gain insights and create a 
                    dashboard using the Watson Analytics platform.
                \item Created reports by cleaning and processing the raw data 
                    using Pandas and Matplotlib.
                \item A fully-working demo was presented to IBM's global 
                    leadership during the \textit{Interconnect} conference in 
                    Las Vegas.
